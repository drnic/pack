- [x] Fix FetchLifecycle tests -> probably make fetcher just return blobs
- [x] Remove fetcher -> create buildpacks retrieved via downloader (blobs)
- [x] Move buildpack to interface similar to lifecycle
- [x] Lifecycle EITHER version or uri, not both
- [ ] Lifecycle nothing older than v0.3.0
- [x] API version types?
- [WIP] API versions in inspect-builder output (the actual story)
- [x] Move buildpack validations to NewBuildpack
- [ ] Check project for TODO
- [ ] Move Version to a different package?
- [ ] Revisit Version pointer structure
- [ ] Validate previous pack acceptance - only set lifecycle version and it should download 0.3.0 (default)
